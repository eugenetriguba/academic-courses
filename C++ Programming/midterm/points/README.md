# C++ Homework 4

final/ houses the final copy to turn in.

src/ is how I actually like to write things, but he
wants it as one file.

I've been using "clang-format" with the clang-format
vs code extension to stick to his style guide without
having to worry about it since it'll just format my code
for me on save. 

I often use a makefile for tasks. I'm using it in WSL, but 
I'm not sure how well it works in Windows normally. You can
just run `make build` and `./main` then to run the program.
Then `make clean` to remove the executable. But it's just 
running g++ commands, no need to use it.
