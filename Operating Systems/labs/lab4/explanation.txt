I'd say the results for me were a bit confusing because of the similarity. 
I expected num3fork to be significantly slower than the two threaded 
programs. I assumed this because the threads are much more light-weight
so creating them is less expensive, and I didn't think an entirely new
process for this program was necessary. I would say trial three went more
like I would have guessed in that num3fork was about 20 seconds slower 
for the first couple processes. However, the results of all three were
fairly similar. Maybe a larger time period could of produced larger 
discrepancies.

The computer used for this assignment was a Windows PC running Windows
subsystem for Linux. The link for the processor it had:
